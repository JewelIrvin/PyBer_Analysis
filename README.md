# PyBer_Analysis

The company V.Isualize wanted us to analyze the ride-sharing data of differnt cities by city type. 

## Overiew of Project
* Deliverable 1: Create a ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
* Deliverable 2: Create a multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
* Deliverable 3: Summary report for the PyBer analysis (README.md)

# Results
* Deliverable 1: Below shows the ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type that was made in both the original format and in the newly formatted version to make it comprehensible.

# Summary
To enhance the efficiency of the business, I recommend reducing the number of drivers in urban cities where there is an excess of drivers compared to the total number of rides, which is nearly double. Conversely, it would be advantageous to increase the number of drivers in rural areas where there is a shortage of drivers, but the demand for rides is higher. Moreover, expanding the number of drivers in suburban areas would also be beneficial. These measures would improve the accessibility of rides for customers and result in an increased number of fares, which would ultimately boost the company's overall revenue.
